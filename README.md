<p align="center">The project uses only one HTML file, which works out-of-the-box and has Javascript and CSS built in.
When entering a Knowunity URL, the script searches for the API-Url used for the Knowunity app and extracts the PDF link from it. It is then displayed in the front end of the website.</p>
